     Course-Project Assignments in Java
     The project simulates the spread of the corona virus
     Adhesions, recoveries, statistics, ramzor colors for settlements, development of variants and more...
     The project is java based and GUI implementation so running can be easily controlled

<h3> Main Window </h3>
        In the main window you can perform a number of actions such as:<br> Map loading, simulation start, 
        simulation speed control and switching to other windows in the application.<br>  <br>

  <h3> Map View </h3>
       The settlements can be seen by locations as well as each settlement is represented by its ramzor color <br>
       and settlements that are connected to each other<br>  <br>

  <h3> Simulation in action </h3>
       Running simulation includes: adhesions, transition between settlements, recovery and death.<br>
       The simulation speed can be controlled in the lower spinner.<br>
       The map is updated in real time<br>  <br>

  <h3> Statistics window </h3>
      The statistics window displays data for each settlement on the map. <br>
      The table can be exported to a log file (opened using excel software).<br>
      Sicks people can be added using the "Add sick" button. <br>
      Vaccine doses can be sent for a specific settlement using the "Vaccinate" button. <br>
      The data in the table is updated in real time.<br>  <br>
